<current_state>
Phase 1 (QuickTaskModal) code was built in previous sessions. UAT testing completed today — 5/6 tests passed. One issue found: no "add task" button on mobile. FAB button fix committed and pushed to master (EDEN-TEST). Awaiting user verification on real mobile device.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- 01-01 Plan execution: QuickTaskModal + DateChip built and wired into App.jsx (commits 9e2bae3, 6e23879)
- UAT testing: 6 tests run, 5 passed (minimal layout, date chip, recurring expand/collapse, quick save, edit existing task)
- FAB fix: Added floating action button for mobile in App.jsx (commit dbcbe46, pushed to master)
- Branch restructure: master → EDEN-TEST, production → EDEN-PRODUCTION, deleted develop branch
- Git push: master pushed to GitHub, EDEN-TEST auto-deploying
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Verify FAB button works on real mobile device (user testing EDEN-TEST deployment)
- If FAB works: mark UAT test 6 as pass, update UAT.md
- If FAB doesn't work: debug and fix
- Merge master → production for EDEN-PRODUCTION update (after FAB verified)
- Update STATE.md to reflect Phase 1 completion
- Create 01-01-SUMMARY.md (was never created after plan execution)
- Move to Phase 2: MyDay Cleanup (plan and execute)
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Branch restructure: master = working branch (EDEN-TEST), production = stable (EDEN-PRODUCTION). Deleted develop branch.
- FAB placement: bottom-left corner (RTL layout), 56x56px, bg-primary, z-30, only visible on mobile (<1024px)
- UAT approach: Tested from PLAN.md success criteria since no SUMMARY.md existed
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- None. Waiting for user to verify FAB on real mobile device.

<context>
The project is a Hebrew RTL maintenance management system. Phase 1 added a Todoist-style QuickTaskModal for fast task creation. All desktop features work. The only gap is mobile needed a FAB button to open the modal — the Sidebar (which has the add button) is hidden on mobile and the MobileDrawer only has navigation items. Fix was committed and pushed, pending verification.

Environment: Backend on port 3002, Frontend on port 5174. EDEN-TEST at web-production-9e1eb.up.railway.app. Machine IP 192.168.1.41.

<next_action>
1. Ask user if FAB works on mobile (EDEN-TEST deployment)
2. If yes: update UAT, create SUMMARY, update STATE, consider merging to production
3. If no: debug the issue
4. Then proceed to Phase 2: MyDay Cleanup (/gsd:discuss-phase 2 or /gsd:plan-phase 2)
