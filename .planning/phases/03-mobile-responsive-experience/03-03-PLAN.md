<objective>
Optimize all interactive elements for touch input with 44x44px minimum tap targets, 8px spacing, and visual tap feedback. Transform hover-only interactions to work on touch devices with active states and scale animations.

Purpose: Ensure reliable, frustration-free interaction on mobile devices - prevents mis-taps and provides responsive visual feedback
Output: Touch-optimized UI that meets WCAG 2.5.8 accessibility standards and Apple Human Interface Guidelines

  <action>
Read client/src/components/shared/TaskCard.jsx and apply touch optimizations:

**Card container (MOB-TOUCH-03):**
- Find the main card div (bg-white rounded-xl shadow-md)
- Add to className: `min-h-[64px]`
- Ensure existing transition classes preserved
- Add touch feedback: `active:scale-[0.98] active:shadow-md`
- Keep existing hover effects (hover:shadow-lg hover:-translate-y-1 likely present)
- Combined result: Hover on desktop (lift + shadow), active on mobile (subtle press)

**Star button (MOB-TOUCH-01):**
- Find star toggle button (likely renders FaStar or FaRegStar)
- Current classes likely include: p-2 rounded-lg
- Transform to touch-optimized:
  - Base: `p-2 rounded-lg`
  - Size: `min-h-[44px] min-w-[44px] flex items-center justify-center`
  - Transitions: `transition-all duration-150`
  - Hover (desktop): `hover:scale-110`
  - Active (touch): `active:scale-90`
  - Color states: Keep existing text-yellow-500 (starred) vs text-gray-400 (unstarred) pattern
  - Hover color: `hover:text-yellow-600` (starred), `hover:text-gray-500` (unstarred)

**Edit button:**
- Similar transformation as star button
- Min size: `min-h-[44px] min-w-[44px]`
- Touch feedback: `active:scale-90`
- Keep existing icon and color scheme

**Delete button (if exists):**
- Same touch optimization pattern
- 44x44px minimum, active:scale-90

**Button spacing (MOB-TOUCH-02):**
- Find button container (likely flex with gap)
- Ensure: `flex gap-2` (gap-2 = 8px minimum spacing)
- If gap is smaller (gap-1 = 4px), increase to gap-2

**Checkbox (if exists for task completion):**
- Wrapper div around checkbox input
- Add: `min-h-[44px] min-w-[44px] flex items-center justify-center`
- This creates 44x44px tap target around checkbox visual element

**Why scale-[0.98] for card:** Research pattern 3 explains this provides subtle "pressed" feedback without being jarring. Scale-95 is too aggressive for large cards. The card should feel responsive but not springy.

**Why active:scale-90 for buttons:** Research pattern 3 shows this is standard for icon buttons. More pronounced than card feedback because buttons are smaller targets that need clearer response.

Apply touch optimizations to navigation and modal components:

**MobileDrawer.jsx:**
- Close button (FaTimes): Already has proper sizing from Plan 01, verify present
- Navigation items: Verify each NavLink has adequate tap target
- Add explicit sizing if missing: `min-h-[44px]` to NavLink className
- Verify gap between nav items: should be `space-y-2` (8px vertical spacing)
- Navigation items already defined in Plan 01 with adequate padding, but ensure explicit min-height present

**HamburgerButton.jsx:**
- Already has min-h-[44px] min-w-[44px] from Plan 01, verify present
- Ensure active:scale-95 feedback present
- No changes needed if Plan 01 implemented correctly

**Modal.jsx:**
- Close button (likely FaTimes or X icon in header)
- Add to close button className:
  - Size: `min-h-[44px] min-w-[44px]`
  - Layout: `flex items-center justify-center`
  - Touch feedback: `active:scale-90`
  - Transitions: `transition-all duration-200`
  - Keep existing color/hover states

**App.jsx floating action button (FAB - plus icon):**
- Find the floating button (renders FaPlus, fixed positioning)
- Current likely: `fixed bottom-6 left-6` or similar
- Transform for mobile (MOB-TOUCH-06):
  - Mobile: `w-14 h-14` (56x56px - standard FAB size)
  - Desktop: Can keep existing size or match mobile
  - Classes: `min-h-[56px] min-w-[56px] flex items-center justify-center`
  - Touch feedback: `active:scale-90 active:shadow-lg`
  - Transitions: `transition-all duration-200`
  - Keep existing rounded-full, bg-primary, shadow styles
- Why 56x56px: Research MOB-TOUCH-06 specifies this is standard FAB size in mobile UX patterns (Material Design, iOS)

**Research context:** Research pitfall 3 warns that buttons <44px cause user frustration and ADA non-compliance. WCAG 2.5.8 requires 24px minimum, but 44px is Apple HIG and recommended standard. 56px for FAB is industry standard for primary action buttons.

- MobileDrawer close button has 44x44px size
- MobileDrawer nav items have adequate tap targets (min-h-[44px])

Apply touch optimizations to all form and page buttons:

**Form submit/cancel buttons (all 5 form files):**
- Find submit button (likely "שמור" or "צור")
- Find cancel button (likely "ביטול")
- Transform both to touch-optimized pattern:
  - Size: `min-h-[44px] px-6` (height 44px, padding maintains rectangular shape)
  - Touch feedback: `active:scale-95`
  - Transitions: `transition-all duration-150`
  - Keep existing color schemes (primary for submit, gray for cancel)
  - Keep existing hover states, add active states

**Form input fields:**
- Mobile-specific consideration: inputs should be `min-h-[44px]` for tap targets
- Check all text inputs, textareas, selects
- Add if missing: `min-h-[44px]` (for single-line inputs)
- Textareas: `min-h-[88px]` (2 lines worth = 2 × 44px)

**Dropdown/select inputs (MOB-TOUCH-07):**
- Research MOB-TOUCH-07 requires native select on mobile
- Current implementation likely uses standard <select> elements - this is CORRECT
- Verify no custom dropdown components are used that might not work on mobile
- If custom dropdowns exist: Ensure they render as native <select> on mobile breakpoints
- Native selects work better on mobile (OS-native picker UI)
- Verification check: Run `grep "<select" client/src/components/forms/*.jsx` to confirm native selects used

**Page action buttons (MyDayPage, AllTasksPage, HistoryPage):**
- "שלח הכל" button (Send All - MyDayPage)
- Star filter button (Sidebar - already touched in Plan 01, verify)
- Any "מיין" (Sort) buttons
- Any "סנן" (Filter) buttons
- Apply same pattern: `min-h-[44px]`, `active:scale-95`, `transition-all duration-150`

**Icon-only buttons pattern:**
- Size: `min-h-[44px] min-w-[44px]`
- Padding: `p-2` (creates internal spacing for icon)
- Flex: `flex items-center justify-center`
- Feedback: `active:scale-90`

**Text buttons pattern:**
- Size: `min-h-[44px] px-4` (or px-6 for primary actions)
- Feedback: `active:scale-95`
- Keep rectangular shape

**Research warning from pitfall 3:** Testing on desktop Chrome is NOT sufficient. Real device testing on iPhone Safari recommended, but if unavailable, use browser mobile emulation with touch simulation enabled.

Overall phase checks after all tasks complete:

**Touch target verification (use browser dev tools):**
1. Measure all buttons with element inspector - confirm >= 44x44px
2. Measure FAB - confirm 56x56px
3. Measure TaskCard buttons - confirm 44x44px
4. Measure form inputs - confirm min-h-[44px]
5. Check spacing between TaskCard buttons - confirm >= 8px

**Touch feedback verification (mobile emulation with touch simulation):**
1. Tap TaskCard - should scale down to 98%
2. Tap star button - should scale down to 90%
3. Tap hamburger button - should scale down to 95%
4. Tap navigation item in drawer - should scale down
5. Tap form submit button - should scale down to 95%
6. Tap FAB - should scale down to 90%

**Visual inspection:**
- All buttons have consistent touch target sizes
- No tiny icon buttons (<44px) remain
- Button spacing looks comfortable (not cramped)
- Icons remain centered within 44px touch targets

**Accessibility verification:**
- WCAG 2.5.8 compliance: All targets >= 24px (exceeded with 44px standard)
- Apple HIG compliance: All targets >= 44x44px
- Material Design compliance: FAB is 56x56px
- Spacing compliance: >= 8px between adjacent targets

**Desktop experience:**
- Verify touch optimizations don't degrade desktop UX
- Hover states still work (complementing active states)
- Buttons don't feel oversized on desktop (44px is acceptable on all devices)
