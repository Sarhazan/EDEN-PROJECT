*Phase 2.1 requirements implemented but not formally verified

## Cross-Phase Integration

### Critical Issues

**1. Star Filter Missing in Mobile Navigation** (HIGH)
- **Phases:** 1 (Stars) + 3 (Mobile)
- **Impact:** Mobile users cannot filter starred tasks — core Phase 1 feature broken on mobile
- **Root Cause:** MobileDrawer.jsx only renders navigation items, does not include star filter button from Sidebar
- **Fix:** Add star filter button to MobileDrawer (LOW complexity)

### Minor Issues

**2. Star Button Touch Target Below Spec** (LOW)
- **Phases:** 1 (Stars) + 3 (Mobile)
- **Impact:** Star button is 36x36px on mobile, should be 44x44px per Apple HIG / Phase 3 spec
- **Fix:** Change Tailwind classes in TaskCard.jsx (TRIVIAL)

### Working Integrations

- Stars + Socket.IO: Real-time broadcasts work correctly
- Stars + Resizable: No layout breaks when columns resized
- Resizable + Mobile: Properly hidden on mobile, stacked layout works
- WhatsApp + Socket.IO: Shared server instance, separate client connections
- WhatsApp + Mobile: Settings page QR/buttons work on mobile
- Mobile Navigation + All Pages: All routes accessible via drawer

## E2E Flow Verification

| Flow | Status | Break Point |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Manager stars task on mobile | BROKEN | Star filter not in MobileDrawer |
| Manager connects WhatsApp on mobile | COMPLETE | - |
| Manager resizes + stars on desktop | COMPLETE | - |

## Unverified Phase: 2.1 WhatsApp Gateway

Phase 2.1 has all 3 plans executed with SUMMARY.md files but no VERIFICATION.md. Post-plan fixes applied:
- Separated WhatsApp connections per environment
- Fixed ready event handling for cloud
- Fixed QR code display issues
- Multiple debug sessions in "verifying" status

## Summary

**What's done well:**
- Core features (Stars, Resizable, Mobile, WhatsApp connection) all implemented
- Socket.IO architecture cleanly shared across features
- Responsive breakpoints integrate seamlessly
- 46/57 defined requirements satisfied

**What needs attention:**
- 3 phases remaining (4, 5, 6) with 21+ requirements
- Star filter missing on mobile (integration gap)
- Phase 2.1 needs formal verification
- 4 debug sessions still in "verifying" status
